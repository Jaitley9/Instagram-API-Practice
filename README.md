# Instagram-API-Practice
A few projects I'm doing to play around with the Instagram API. You can take a look at and use some of the methods I've made.

#gramFan
Find out who your biggest fan is on Instagram. A quick console application which will go through your posts on Instagram and print out an ordered list of who liked the most and how many they liked. Change parameters through the source file for now. I'll set up commandline arguments soon. 

#Things Planned: 
I want to eventually move these projects so that they can be accessed via a webpage.
